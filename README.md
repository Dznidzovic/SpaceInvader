# SpaceInvader
Space invader game built with MERN stack.
First it features dummy authentication system. 
After that you can play the game and achieve the highest possible score. Your score will be shown on the scoreboard menu alongside other players.
The game is pretty simple, Enemies spawn rate increases with time, so does your movement speed. Use w,a,s,d for movement and left click for shooting. 
You have 5 lives, and a life is lost either if the enemy crosses the bottom line of the screen or if the enemy projectile hits you.
Also once in a game you have the ability to activate the machine gun. Press z and start shooting. This ability lasts for 10 seconds and can't be reused so use it wisely.
Have fun!
